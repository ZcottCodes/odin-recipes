        I have never made taco lasagna before. Truth be told, I am not sure if I have heard of it before!<br>
        But I have heard of it now, and by the grace of God I will one day make this.</p>
    </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500g mince meat or plant based mince</li>
            <li>2 (1.25 ounce) packages of taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>18 6inch tortillas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese </li>
        </ul>

    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1</li>
        <p>Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly browned. Drain, then season with taco seasoning, garlic, chili powder, and cayenne pepper. Pour in water. Simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2</li>
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3</li>
        <p>Place 6 tortillas into the prepared baking dish. Spread 1/3 of the salsa on top of the tortillas. Spread 1/2 of the meat mixture evenly over the salsa. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions. Drop 1/2 of the sour cream randomly over the green onions. Top with 1/2 cup Cheddar and 1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat layers. Top with 6 tortillas, spread with remaining salsa, and sprinkle with remaining cheese.</p>
        <li style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 45 minutes or until cheeses are melted.</p>
    </ol>
